            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Armes in the House, which was almost as many as we had taken in all the other Castles, the same night I lay at the <hi>Broffe,</hi> I sent two Regiments to see what they could do upon a Castle of one <hi>Boxes</hi> within halfe a myle of it, where his son
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205867:4"/>was Commander, and denyed to yeeld to me upon such quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as I had given others, These two Regiments, assaulted the great ditch, which was their Banne fence, and carryed every man a burthen of the thach of houses to the Grate of the Castle, which being fired, and the wind sitting favourab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they maintained the fire so, as in two houres the people were unable to stay within, and having no other way, began to come out of the Windowes, but our men killed the first that came, the rest fled to the Battlements, where they stayed till our men had made a breach with barres of Iron, and then they comming up to them, some leaped over the top of the Castle, which was very high, but they were all slaine except one, who was saved by meere accident, the next day I sent a party of Horse to <hi>Baggots</hi> Castle, who had taken over night two of our horsemen, with their Horses and Armes, suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they would bee glad to give up my horsemen upon condition I would let him alone, which of necessity I must have done for want of Ammunition, for I had not one graine of Powder left that was serviceable, when the Horse surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and summoned him, he desired to speake with me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I came thither, whilst the army was marching towards home, in expectation to have the place presently given up, but the Monsier propounded only coming under contribtion, and said he ment not to yeeld (if we did our utmost) upon other tearms, whereat I was troubled, that I was come thither in person, and though I saw the place weak, not able to force it But I spoke big words of sending for the Ordinance instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and told him, I would make him purchase his abuse of my expectation at a dear rate, and that I would heare of no further treaty. Whereupon the Gentleman desired some time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and at length was perswaded to give us our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, with their Horses and Armes, and 16. Horses more, whereof 10 were the best in that Country, we got also a 100 l. in mony to be rid of us, and so came away that night into our own Quarters to <hi>Ardskiegh,</hi> and the next day hither to meet with what provision and ammunition was provided for us, which being but 2 l. of Bisquet, and 1 l. of Cheese a man; we are this day marching away to the releife of <hi>Ballagary</hi> and <hi>Castlematresse,</hi> where we left wards, who have been besieged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205867:4"/>these 3. dayes (that I have been out of the County of <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>) but to morrow I shall with Gods help be with them, and I must indeavour to do now, as <hi>I</hi> did last time, live all the time we are abroad upon the Country, which now I doubt will afford us only Pease and Beans, which we hope will keep us from starving, though we should get nothing else, if it do not, there is no visible means for us to avoyd it, for we have not a bit of provision, nor a penny of mony in our Garrisons, where the Towns relieve the sick men, and the well subsist by their own acquisitions. Wherefore, <hi>I</hi> beseech you Sir, either get us releife that may enable us to live here, or get me leave to come off, and let them give my Command to whom they please. I can contribute Faithfullnesse and Integrity to the preservation of their intrests, but I can work no Miracles.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese ticklish times give mee small hopes that any thing as yet can bee done in the behalfe of our Forces in <hi>Munster,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I very much desire the honour to wait on you over; I believe you will take shippe either at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> or <hi>Minehead.</hi> I shall gladly wait on at either of them. Give me leave to acquaint you what a Member of your House told me; who yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day came home from <hi>London:</hi> he bid me be confident that you intended to quit your command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that my Lord President is speedily to appeare at <hi>London,</hi> to answer to that Charge which my Lord <hi>Broghill,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Loftus</hi> exhibited against him. I beseech you to deale ingeniously with me in this particular, for I am resolv'd to desert the service if it bee true, and so will many besides. Its a lamentable encouragement for any man to leave his native Country, spend his fortune and hazard his life, when he shall see men, who have done such eminent services thus required. But I trust God will so far manifest his Iustice, as not to suffer the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous malice of these men to prevaile; pardon I pray the trouble this long peece of impertinency puts you to. I have a long time had a very high esteeme of you, but never could bee so happy to have an occasion to bee knowne by you, unto whom in all things, I shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,</p>
